# Simple Password Manager
Qt application written in C++
Allows the storage of custom password entries in a local SQL database.

User can create a new vault or open an existing vault by inputting their master password.

Users can add/update/remove entries once access to the vault has been established.

All stored passwords are encrypted and stored in the database using a AES-256 cipher with randomly generated IV and symmetric key.
